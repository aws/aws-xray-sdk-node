## Installing

The AWS X-Ray SDK for Node.js is compatible with Node.js version 12.x and later.
There may be issues when running on the latest odd-numbered release of Node.js.

The latest stable version of the SDK is available from NPM. For local development, install the SDK in your project directory with npm.

```
npm install aws-xray-sdk
```

Use the --save option to save the SDK as a dependency in your application's `package.json`.

```
npm install aws-xray-sdk --save
```

## Documentation

This repository hosts all the packages we publish, which each have their own README. The [Core package README](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/tree/master/packages/core) covers all basic use cases of the main X-Ray SDK, including its use in Lambda.
The [developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide) provides in-depth
guidance about using the AWS X-Ray service and SDKs.
The [API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray-sdk-for-nodejs/latest/reference/)
provides guidance for using this SDK and module-level documentation.

- [aws-xray-sdk-restify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-xray-sdk-restify)
- [Community contributed packages](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/tree/master/sdk_contrib)

## Community contributions for new Middleware
If you'd like to add support for a new web framework by writing middleware for X-Ray, 
please do so by creating a new package within the `sdk_contrib` 
[directory](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/tree/master/sdk_contrib).
We are not accepting pull requests for first-party packages at this time, 
but will be more than happy to host them as community contributions. This means that AWS will:

- Host them in this repository
- Publish them to NPM
- Consider them the officially recommended way of using X-Ray with that framework
- Review & merge pull requests made against them by the community
- Allow issues related to them on this repo for visibility to the community

AWS will not:

- Provide first party support through AWS Forums, AWS customer support, etc for things like questions & debugging help
- Actively develop on them (e.g. if we add a feature to the Express middleware, it will not necessarily be added to middleware in `sdk_contrib`)

## Testing from Source

This repo uses [Lerna](https://lernajs.io) to manage multiple packages. To install Lerna as a CLI:
```
npm install -g lerna
```
To install devDependencies and peerDependencies for all packages:
```
lerna bootstrap --hoist
```
This repo has a combination of TypeScript and JavaScript source files. To transpile the TypeScript files for testing, run:
```
lerna run compile
```
To run tests for all packages:
```
lerna run test
```
or go to each package and run `npm test` as usual.
