## 2.1.0
* bugfix: Fixed an undefined method in `DaemonConfig`. [#ISSUE52](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/issues/52)
* bugfix: Fixed an issue in transforming sampling rule definition file from v1 to v2. [#PR70](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/pull/70)

## 2.0.0
### Breaking Changes
* The default sampler now launches background tasks to poll sampling rules from X-Ray backend. See more details here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-nodejs-configuration.html#xray-sdk-nodejs-configuration-sampling.
* `shouldSample` method now takes an object containing rule matching information and returns the rule name if sampled based on a service rule.
* `Sampler` renamed to `LocalReservoir` to reflect the default sampling strategy change.
* `SamplingRules` renamed to `LocalSampler` to reflect the default sampling strategy change.

### New
* feature: Environment variable `AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS` now takes an additional notation in `tcp:127.0.0.1:2000 udp:127.0.0.2:2001` to set TCP and UDP destination separately. By default it assumes a X-Ray daemon listening to both UDP and TCP traffic on `127.0.0.1:2000`.
* improvement: Winston has been updated to 2.4.4 to reduce bundle size. [#PR51](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/pull/51)
* bugfix: Set callback to undefined in mysql capture. [#PR47](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/pull/47)
* bugfix: Address an issue where a log message cannot be suppressed by user. [#ISSUE2](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/issues/2)

## 1.3.0

* improvement: Underscore is replaced by lodash for smaller bundle size. [#PR43](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/pull/43)
* feature: New method `patchThirdPartyPromise` so you can patch context binding on third party promise libraries. [#PR40](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/pull/40)
* docs: Fix node version requirement on docs. [#PR46](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/pull/46)

* feature: All S3 operations are added to `aws_whitelist.json`. [#PR17](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/pull/17)

* bugfix: Fixed http client capture with a string passed in `get()` and `request()`. [#ISSUE16](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/issues/16)
* bugfix: Fixed http subsegment would be left unclosed if response is not consumed. [#ISSUE18](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node/issues/18)

## 1.1.7

## 1.1.5

* feature: Added AWSXray.appendAWSWhitelist function to append to the current whitelist loaded.
* bugfix: Fixed compatibility issues with webpack in regard to custom sampling rules and AWS whitelists.
* bugfix: Fixed issue where partial subsegment streaming would throw an error on 'undefined'.
* bugfix: Fixed issue where AWS call response descriptors were attempting to be read on an error.

## 1.1.1
* feature: Added debug logs for sampling rates and matches.
* feature: Added patcher for the http.get helper function as a part of the captureHTTPs function.
* bugfix: Fixed issue where default fixed target/rate set to zero in sampling rate file would erroneously throw an error.
* bugfix: Fixed issue where url capturing for incoming requests was coded to an Express-only property.
* bugfix: Fixed issue with S3 calls where only x-amz-id-2 was captured as request ID. Added 'id_2' property to properly capture S3 request ID pairs.
* bugfix: Fixed issue where capturing a count of parameters on a parameter of an AWS call when the parameter wasn't defined would capture 'undefined'.
* bugfix: Fixed compatibility issue with webpack.

* **BREAKING** change: Segment.addSDKVersions() reworked into setSDKData().
* **BREAKING** change: Segment.addServiceVersions() reworked into setServiceData().
* change: Capturing AWS and HTTP calls in manual mode now uses a param 'XRaySegment' rather than 'Segment'.  Backwards compatible, see usage examples in README.md.
