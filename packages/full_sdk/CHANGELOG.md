## 1.0.6-beta
* **BREAKING** change: added a `setContextMissingStrategy` function to the `AWSXRay` module. This allows configuration of the exception behavior exhibited when trace context is not properly propagated. The behavior can be configured in code. Alternatively, the environment variable `AWS_XRAY_CONTEXT_MISSING` can be used (overrides any modes set in code). Valid values for this environment variable are currently (case insensitive) `RUNTIME_ERROR` and `LOG_ERROR`. The default behavior is changing from `LOG_ERROR` to `RUNTIME_ERROR`, i.e. by default, an exception will be thrown on missing context.
* **BREAKING** change: Renamed the capture module's exported functions `capture`, `captureAsync`, and `captureCallback` to `captureFunc`, `captureAsyncFunc`, and `captureCallbackFunc`, respectively.
* change: Changed the behavior when loading multiple plugins to set the segment origin using the latest-loaded plugin.
* change: Removed the `Subsegment` `addRemote` setter. `Subsegment` namespaces can be set directly using the `namespace` attribute.
* change: Changed the name of the `Segment`/`Subsegment` `addThrottle` method to `addThrottleFlag`.
* change: Removed the `type` parameter from the `Segment`/`Subsegment` `addError` and `close` methods.
* feature: Added `addFaultFlag` and `addErrorFlag` methods to `Segment` and `Subsegment`.
* feature: Added additional version information to the `aws.xray` segment property.
* bugfix: Fixed issue where loading multiple plugins using `XRay.config` did not set all applicable data in the segment's `aws` attribute.

## 1.0.5-beta
* change: Changed the expected sampling file format. See README for details.
* change: Removed the default file logger. You can set a custom logger via AWSXRay.setLogger().
* change: Moved the AWSXRay.setSamplingRules() function to AWSXRay.middleware.setSamplingRules().
* change: Changed various AWS DynamoDB params on the AWS param whitelist file.
* change: Removed 'paths' property on segment and subsegment cause blocks for error capturing.
* change: Changed logging max backlog files to 3 with max size of 300kB each.
* feature: Added AWSXRay.setStreamingThreshold(<number>) and partial subsegment streaming.
* feature: Added an 'x_forwarded_for' flag attribute in regard to capturing inbound http request data.
* feature: Added AWS Lambda Invoke and InvokeAsync params to the AWS param whitelist file.
* feature: Added a configuration option to set a custom logger via AWSXRay.setLogger().
* feature: Added 'error' and 'fault' flags for HTTP response statuses for outbound calls.
* feature: Added 'For Node.js' on SDK version capturing.
* bugfix: Fixed issue with throttle flag on downstream AWS calls.
* bugfix: Fixed issue where 'error' and 'fault' flags were being set improperly.
* bugfix: Fixed issue where sampling rules were not being observed.
* bugfix: Fixed issue where sampling rules validation was not checking the expected format.
* bugfix: Fixed issue where an error loading the AWS Elastic Beanstalk plugin would be improperly logged.
* bugfix: Fixed issue where calling addError and passing a string would throw an error.

## 1.0.4-beta

* change: Renamed XRAY_DEBUG_MODE environment variable to AWS_XRAY_DEBUG_MODE.
* change: Removed XRAY_TRACING_DEFAULT_NAME environment variable.
* change: Removed AWSXRay.setDefaultName(). A default name is now required via AWSXRay.express.openSegment(<defaultName>).
* change: Minimum AWS SDK version required for capturing is 2.7.15.
* feature: Added AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS environment variable.
* feature: Added AWSXRay.setDaemonAddress(<address>) function that accepts an IPv4 address. See README for details.
* feature: Introducing 'fixed' (default) and 'dynamic' naming modes. Enable dynamic mode via AWSXRay.middleware.enableDynamicNaming(<optionalPattern>).
* feature: Added a 'remote' attribute flag to mark errors from downstream services.
* feature: Added 'service' 'version' attribute to capture NPM module version of your application.
* feature: Added 'aws' 'sdk' version' attribute to capture AWS X-RAY SDK version.
